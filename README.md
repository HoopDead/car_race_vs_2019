# Car Race Project
Project is on going process for my University Classes - Project in C++ Language

## 1. Idea

- Create API for handle information about player, map, auth tokens.
- Create Multiplayer 2D Game, where players can compete with each other on diffrent maps.
- Whole project is based on Racing Games ideas, where player will have to take three laps and end whole race on first position to win.

## 2. Development Plan

With Python, Django and Django REST API Libary build an API for handling real time informations about players. Test everything with pytest libary.

With C++ (don't know what version yet) and SFML 2.5 libary (using Networking an Graphics tools) create game.

## 3. Technologies

**NETWORKING AND BACKEND**: Pytohn, Django, Django REST API, Pytest
**GAME ENGINE**: C++, SFML
